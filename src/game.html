    </h2>

    <p>
        In a land where Tetris ruled, four pink dinosaurs - Alexa, Safaa, Dimi, and Ricky - stumbled upon the game. Intrigued, they decided to take over. With Alexa's smarts, Safaa's speed, Dimi's planning, and Ricky's energy, they quickly mastered the blocks. Before anyone knew it, Tetris was transformed into their own game: Dinosaur Take-Over, where fun reigned supreme
